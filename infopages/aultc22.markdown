# An invitation to an open discussion to explore the potential of Immersive Virtual Reality as a pedagogical tool
## Sarah Wydall, Helen Miles, & Andra Jones

This session shares the background development & some of the preliminary findings from an evaluation of a working prototype I-VR tool from the Welsh Government pilot study 'Through their eyes'.

This mixed methods evaluation highlighted the value of I-VR as a training tool to improve the response to domestic abuse. 
 
The inter-disciplinary team from the Depts of Computer Science and Criminology provide a demonstration of I-VR; an insight into their perceptions of the experience and share next steps.

We examine the literature on IVR as a pedagogical tool and ask how this technology can enhance student learning experience.  We will then open the discussion to look at the wider applications of I-VR for UG and PG students across a range of disciplines
