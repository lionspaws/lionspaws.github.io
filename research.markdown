## (1) Am I the right person?
If you're interested in exploring some of the areas I've mentioned above then that's a good start! If you are interested in studying at Aber Uni but aren't interested in the same research areas then have a look at our [department's research webpages](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/research/). We have four research groups that cover a wide variety of areas! There are also links to some currently available positions, and past projects.
