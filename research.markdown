# Postrgraduate Research Opportunities
If you are looking for PGR opportunities and want to contact me, here is some information that will hopefully help to answer some intial questions you might have.

## Am I the right supervisor?
If you're interested in exploring some of the areas I've mentioned above then that's a good start! If you are interested in studying at Aber Uni but aren't interested in the same research areas then have a look at our [department's research webpages](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/research/). We have four research groups that cover a wide variety of areas! There are also links to some currently available positions, and past projects.

## Funding
Unfortunately I don't have dedicated funding available for PGR studentships, but I do sometimes apply for scholarships, usually with project ideas attached, for example with the [UKRI AIMLAC CDT](http://cdt-aimlac.org/cdt-main.html).

Some other options to explore:
- [Aber Uni scholarships](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/study-with-us/fees/postgrad/uk/research/)
- [Student Finance Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/postgraduate-finance/doctoral/) and [Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/doctoral-loan)
- [GovUK Guide on Funding for postgraduate study](https://www.gov.uk/funding-for-postgraduate-study)
